# Week 4

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

[Bookmark Manager learning objectives](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/bookmark_manager/learning_objectives.md)


**I would like to improve** using class variables, and extracting out _all_ the classes

## Goals

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)
