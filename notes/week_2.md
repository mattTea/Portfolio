# Week 2

_A weekly journal to keep track of the work I am doing towards each of the goals._

[Weekly outline](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/week_outlines.md/)

------

## Goals

1. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
    - [Takeaway]()
    - [Oystercard]()

2. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
    - [Takeaway]()
    - [Oystercard]()

3. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
    - [Example project]()

4. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
    - Riya's airport challenge [pull request](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/1346)

5. Use all of week 1's skills
    - [Example project]()
